Antenna Analysis is a python tool to process and plot antenna radiation patterns from measurements or simulations.

The tool is command line only and requires a binding python script to run. A template script is provided.

The tool is tested to work with python 3.6 and above.
The following python **packages** are required for proper operation. The versions given are recommended but others might also work:

- numpy 1.20.2
- matplotlib 3.4.1
- scipy 1.6.3

Please consider the required settings described in :ref:`sec_cst_settings` when planning to use the tool for CST simulated patterns.
