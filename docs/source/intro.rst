Antenna Analysis is a python tool to process and plot antenna radiation patterns from measurements or simulations.

The tool is command line only and requires a binding python run script. A template script is provided.

The tool is tested to work with both python 2.7 and 3.6.
The following pyhton **packages** are required for proper operation. The versions given are recommended but others might also work:

- numpy 1.14.0 / 1.14.3 / 1.15.4
- matplotlib 2.2.3 / 3.0.0 / 3.0.2
- scipy 1.0.0 / 1.1.0

Please consider the required settings described in :ref:`sec_cst_settings` when planning to use the tool for CST simulated patterns.
